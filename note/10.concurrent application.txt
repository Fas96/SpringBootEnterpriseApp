Bound Resources

Resources of a fixed size or number used in a concurrent environ- ment.
Examples include database connections and fixed-size read/ write buffers.


Mutual Exclusion

Only one thread can access shared data or a shared resource at a time.


Starvation

One thread or a group of threads is prohibited from proceeding for an excessively long time or forever.
 For example, always let- ting fast-running threads through
first could starve out longer run- ning threads if there is no end to the fast-running threads.

Deadlock

Two or more threads waiting for each other to finish. Each thread has
 a resource that the other thread requires and neither can finish until
 it gets the other resource.

 Livelock

 Threads in lockstep, each trying to do work but finding another “in the way.” Due to resonance,
 threads continue trying to make progress but are unable to for an excessively long time— or forever.
